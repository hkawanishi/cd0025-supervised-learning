    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "\n",
    "** Please note ** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like. In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon which you are looking to improve.

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "Random Forest has a very high accuracy percentage in training but much lower in testing. This indicates that Random Forest overfits the data. The overfitting might be avoided if I can tune to the right hyperparameters, but since AdaBoost is already displaying the consistent results in both training and testing results, I decided AdaBoost is the best model to go foward. SVC model has the similar accuracy and fbeta score results, but since the computation time is large, AdaBoost is preferred."

    "\n",
    "AdaBoost is one of the emsemble methods algorithm and uses a \"boosting\" method. From what I learned in this Udacity course (Introduction to Machine Learning with TensorFlow), AdaBoost fits the first learner in order to maximize accuracy. Then, it focuses on the mistakes this learner made and put bigger weights on those misclassified points. The second learner focuses on these misclassificed points. After the second learner, once again the model would put bigger weights on the misclassified points, and repeat the process. That means the process is done sequenctially. When the process is done, combine them by adding and subtracting the weights to produce the final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there is another ensemble algorithm called \"bagging\". Contrary to the boosting which is a sequential method, bagging is a parallel method. The bagging takes random subsets of the data, train a weak independent learner of each of these subsets, and then combine the results by using the majority voting. As explained above, the boosting method resamples over weighted data while the bagging uses equal weights."

    "\n",
    "Of the thirteen avaiable features, I believe that the following four feature are important: capital-gain, capital-loss, hours-per-week, age. I think that people with high income tend to invest thier money and have capital gain/loss in their accounts. On the other hand, for people who have very low income, they might be struggling to have an extra money to invest and they don't have any investment account. I think hours-per-week is also the important feature because the data probably include part-time jobs which tend not to generate income more than full-time job. Age probably matters. For those who are older tend to have more job experiences and that lead to earn more income. I struggle to think one more feature. Maybe native-country is also one of the important features because of difference in currency value.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this is my prediction in order: **capital-gain**, **capital-loss**, **hours-per-week**, **age**, **native-country**.\n",
    "\n",
    "(note: Please see my answer in Question 7. Laser, I realized that I interpreted wrong about \"native-country\" column.)"

    "According to the graph above, the five most relevant features are: Capital-gain, capital-loss, age, hours-per-week, education-num. I predicted four out of five features correctly.\n",
    "In Question 6, I answered \"native-country\" instead of \"education-num\". The reason I was wrong about was that I misunderstood what \"native-country\" column data are. I somehow thought \"native-country\" is the country people are currently working, instead of where they were originally from. The reason I initially picked \"native-country\" was based on the assumption that the currency values are different in different countries. And since I misunderstood the data column and my assumption was irrelevant, it is clear why that feature was not important."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "* Accuracy and F-score on the reduced data are lower than those on full data. \n",
    "* F-score is about 4 percent less on the reduced data compared with that on full data. I am not comfortable running the reduced data without further investigation. According to the bar graph above, I can see the first four features have large enough weight values to consider that they are important. However, \"education-num\" has the weight value of 0.01, and the next two features have the weight value of 0.008 which is very close to \"education-num\" weight value. Therefore, if \"education-num\" is considered important, I might have to include the next two features as well. Furthermore, the following eight features have the weight values of 0.004. So I have to consider carefully if I want to also include these features. If the training time is somewhat a factor, I might try to run and investigate with the fifteen features with the weight value of 0.004 and higher. If reducing the training time was the number one factor, I might consider running top four features instead of five. "
